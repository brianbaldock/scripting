# Microsoft FastTrack Open Source - AAD PowerShell - Licensing usage versus available

## Dependencies
- Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph

## Usage
    .DESCRIPTION
        This script is to help you automate a decision process around which subscription you want to assign users to. 
        This is meant to be used in combination with Azure AD Dynamic Groups for group-based licensing but 
        can also be used for direct signed licensing. 
        
        The idea for this script came when approached about a complex licensing scenario which effectively equaled an M365 E5 license 
        but was segmented across multiple subset subscription types as well as the M365 E5 grouping. 

        The idea is to be able to detect a preferred licenses current usage and assign a user to it and only assign the user the alternative 
        subscription if the preferred license is completely in use. This will allow for automated assigning of different licenses according to current usage.
